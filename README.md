a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

## Learning how to code by helping out
Do you want to learn how to code by contributing to a real project? this project is the answer. 

## Getting started
To help out you will need to be able to use github, use a text editor, and be willing to learn JavaScript, Sails, and Node.

To contribute
* install node.js 
* Install the github app
* fork this project and clone it to your machine
* install a text editor


### Node
Get  [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

### Github
Get an account in [github](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.

Install the github client [GitHub Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [GitHub Mac](https://mac.github.com/) 

Focus first on learning how to use the Github app to quickly get code, save it in github, and collaborate with others. 

### text editor

If you are learning how to code, get a text editor that will do syntax highlight and help you with indentations at first. The two that I like are

   - [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) 
   - [Geddit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit) 

The two editors that most professionals use are 
[vim](http://www.vim.org/)
[emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

If you are starting to code, __DO NOT USE THEM__. They take time to learn how to use because of how many features they have. They are a side quest; a good and honorable one, but they can distract you from what matters.

### JavaScript

My favorite resource for JavaScript is [Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) 

Beware of older sites and books. There has been a lot of changes in how people use JavaScript in the last 5 years versus the previous 15 that preceded them. 

## The stack:  Sails, Express, and Node

The framework that this project uses is [Sails](http://sailsjs.org), which is built on [Express](http://expressjs.com/), which in turn is built on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Most of the time finding information about Sails will be enough to get a task done. But in the answers they may discuss express or node.
